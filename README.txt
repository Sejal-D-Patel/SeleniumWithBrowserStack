Selenium Java Maven Project with BrowserStack

Overview:
This is a Maven project for automating web testing using Selenium WebDriver with Java, and it's configured to run tests on multiple browsers using BrowserStack. This README will guide you through setting up and running Selenium tests with BrowserStack.

Prerequisites:
Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Java JDK
- Maven
- Your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- BrowserStack account

Getting Started:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your Java IDE.

3. Install project dependencies using Maven. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt from the project's root directory:mvn clean install

4. Set up your BrowserStack account and obtain the necessary credentials (Username and Access Key) to authenticate your tests.

5. Create a `config.properties` file in the `src/test/resources` directory. Add your BrowserStack credentials and other configuration settings. You can use the `config-sample.properties` as a template.

6. Define your test scripts in the `src/test/java` directory, configuring them to execute on BrowserStack using the desired capabilities.

Running Tests on BrowserStack:
1. To run your tests on BrowserStack, update your test scripts to use BrowserStack-specific capabilities and set up the test environment for the desired browser, version, and OS combination.

2. Run your tests using the xml from the project's

3. Your tests will execute on BrowserStack, and you can view the results in your BrowserStack dashboard.

Configuration:
- The `config.properties` file in the `src/test/resources` directory should contain your BrowserStack credentials and other configuration options for your test environment.
